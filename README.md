### Project Overview

 Hello budding Data Scientists. We have with us a bank data set which gives information about the revenue of various customers spread across different regions in USA.

Using the knowledge of Pandas and Matplotlib, we will try to answer certain questions from the bank dataset

We will also then scrape certain additional data from Wikipedia, clean it and combine it with our bank data for better understandability of the data.
